## Docs

### `->pollTimer($timeInSecs)`

#### Description
`polltimer` can be used to set how often the browser should inform Filament that the user is still viewing the page, along with getting an updated list of other users also viewing. It is advised not to put this value too short, as it can cause rate limiting issues. But also not to have this value too long, as it will result in a delayed update of new users viewing the page.

#### Arguments
`timeInSeconds` - (int) The amount of time in seconds between each poll. Default is 30 seconds.

### `->identifier($fnc)`

#### Description
`identifier` is used as a unique identifier for this gaze banner. Any other gaze banners with the same identifier will share the same list of active users. This can be useful if you want 2 or more difference resources to share the same list of active viewing users.

#### Arguments
`fnc` - (optional, closure | string) The name of the identifier. Default is the resource's model class combines with model Id.

### `->lock($fnc)`

#### Description
`lock` can be used to lock the resource for anyone but the current person editing the form. This can be useful if you want to prevent multiple people from editing the same resource at the same time. The designated controller is the first person to access the resource, or the person who has taken control of the resource. If you enable this after recently accessing a resource, you may need to run `php artisan cache:clear` as it is possible that the current cached viewers don't have a marked controller (This is only an issue for development).

#### Arguments
`fnc` - (optional, closure | bool) If the resource is lockable or not.

### `->canTakeControl($fnc)`

#### Description
`canTakeControl` can be used to allow the user to take control of the resource if it is locked by someone else. This can be useful if you want to allow the user to take control of the resource.

#### Arguments
`fnc` - (optional, closure | bool) If the user can take control of the resource. Default is true. If a closure is passed, it should return a bool.

### `->hideOnCreate()`

#### Description
`hideOnCreate` is a helper function that can be used to hide the banner on create forms.

## Customization

### Change icons

To [customize the icons](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/support/icons#replacing-the-default-icons) in the banner, you may use the following aliases:

- `filament-gaze::banner.locked` for the lock icon
- `filament-gaze::banner.view` for the eye icon
